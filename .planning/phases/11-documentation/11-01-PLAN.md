<objective>
Update README.md to include MCP Inspector testing instructions before the existing Testing section. This enables users to quickly test their MCP servers using the official Inspector tool.

Purpose: Users can discover and use MCP Inspector for testing immediately after building the project.
Output: Updated README.md with Inspector testing section (UI and CLI modes).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update README.md with Inspector Testing section</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Update README.md to add an "Inspector Testing" section. The section should be inserted AFTER the "Usage" section and BEFORE the existing "Testing" section.

Follow the structure from CONTEXT.md decisions:
- Code-first approach: show working commands first
- Separate UI mode (interactive) from CLI mode (scriptable)
- Include ASCII diagram showing stdio communication flow
- Reference TESTING.md for detailed guide

The Inspector Testing section must include:

1. **What is Inspector?** (2-3 sentences)
   - MCP Inspector is an official testing tool for MCP servers
   - Supports both interactive UI mode and scriptable CLI mode
   - Uses stdio transport to communicate with your server

2. **ASCII diagram** showing message flow:
```
MCP Inspector → Server Communication (stdio mode):

Inspector          Your Server
   (Client)         (stdio mode)
      │                  │
      │ 1. initialize    │
      │ ────────────────>│
      │                  │
      │ 2. initialize    │
      │ <────────────────│
      │                  │
      │ 3. tools/list    │
      │ ────────────────>│
      │                  │
      │ 4. tools/list    │
      │ <────────────────│
```

3. **UI Mode (Interactive Testing)**
```bash
# Build the example server first
cmake --build build --target inspector_server

# Connect via Inspector (opens browser to http://localhost:6274)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector connect stdio ./build/examples/inspector_server
```

4. **CLI Mode (Scriptable Testing)**
```bash
# List available tools
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli ./build/examples/inspector_server --method tools/list

# Call a tool
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli ./build/examples/inspector_server \
    --method tools/call --tool-name calculate --tool-arg operation=add --tool-arg a=5 --tool-arg b=3
```

5. **Important note** about initialize handshake:
   - MCP requires initialize before most operations
   - Inspector handles this automatically
   - Manual testing needs: `{ echo initialize; echo request; } | server`

6. **Link to TESTING.md**: "See TESTING.md for detailed BATS testing guide and writing custom tests"

DO NOT modify these existing sections:
- Features (keep as-is)
- Requirements (keep as-is)
- Quick Start (keep as-is, but ensure it references Inspector Testing)
- Usage (keep as-is)
- Testing (existing ctest section - keep as-is)
- All sections after Testing

Also update the Quick Start section to include Inspector testing as a verification step:
After "Run tests" line, add:
```bash
# Test with MCP Inspector (requires Node.js)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector connect stdio ./build/examples/inspector_server
```

Keep existing examples/TESTING.md reference intact - add root TESTING.md reference as "See TESTING.md for BATS testing guide"
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Check README.md contains "Inspector Testing" section heading
2. Check section includes both UI and CLI mode examples
3. Check section includes ASCII diagram
4. Check Quick Start references Inspector testing
5. Check section comes before existing "Testing" section
6. Check link to TESTING.md exists
  </verify>
  <done>
README.md has Inspector Testing section with:
- "Inspector Testing" heading
- ASCII diagram showing stdio message flow
- UI mode example with npx connect command
- CLI mode examples with --method flags
- Initialize handshake note
- Link to TESTING.md for detailed guide
- Quick Start references Inspector testing
</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing the task, verify:
1. README.md is valid Markdown (no broken formatting)
2. All code blocks are properly fenced with ```bash or ```text
3. Links to TESTING.md are correct
4. The Inspector Testing section appears before the existing Testing section
5. Quick Start includes Inspector testing verification step
</verification>

<success_criteria>
README.md includes complete Inspector Testing section that enables users to:
- Understand what MCP Inspector is
- Test their server interactively via UI mode
- Test their server via CLI mode for scripting
- Learn where to find more detailed testing documentation (TESTING.md)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/11-documentation/11-01-SUMMARY.md` with:
- Changes made to README.md
- Section ordering confirmation
- Links added
</output>
